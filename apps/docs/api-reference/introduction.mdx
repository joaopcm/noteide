## Welcome

This is the API used by the Snipshare application. It is a RESTful API that allows you to manage your snippets and share them with others.

Snipshare is a multi-tenant SaaS application. It is built with [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), and uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) as the ORM.

Also, it uses <Tooltip tip="Role-Based Access Control">RBAC</Tooltip> to manage user roles and permissions. It means that each user has a role that defines what they can do in the application.
