description: "Understand how each code block instance is managed"

The `CodeEditorProvider` is the responsible for providing the necessary context to each code block instance. It means that you have to wrap each code block with this provider.

This provider takes care of internal state management, such as the current code block snippet, the script output, and if the code block is currently running.

This provider exposes the following properties:

1. `code`: The current code snippet.
2. `setCode`: A function to update the current code snippet.
3. `output`: The current script output.
4. `setOutput`: A function to update the current script output.
5. `isRunning`: A boolean indicating if the code block is currently running.
6. `setIsRunning`: A function to update the running state.
7. `evaluateCode`: A function responsible for preparing a blank, secure environment and running the current code snippet.

These properties are easily accessible through the `useCodeEditor` hook, which is the recommended way to interact with the `CodeEditorProvider`.
