---

The `ControlButton` component is responsible for requesting the execution of a code block, or stopping it. It is a simple button that listens to changes in the `isRunning` property of the `CodeEditorProvider` and performs the appropriate action.

If the code block is running, the button will:

1. Destroy the current container instance by calling the `destroyWebContainerInstance` function
2. Clear the output by setting the `output` property to an empty array of strings
3. Set the `isRunning` property to `false`

Otherwise, the button will:
1. Request the execution of the code block by calling the `evaluateCode` function

## Props

```ts
interface ControlButtonProps
  extends React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement> {}
```

## Style

The `ControlButton` component is an unstyled button by default. You can style it by passing your own CSS classes or styles to the `className` or `style` props, respectively.

Also, you can provide any other props that a regular `button` element accepts, such as `onClick`, `disabled`, and `aria-label`.
