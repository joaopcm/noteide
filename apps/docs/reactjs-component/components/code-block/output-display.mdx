The `OutputDisplay` component is responsible for displaying the output of a code block execution. It is a simple `div` that listens to changes in the `output` property of the `CodeEditorProvider` and displays the output accordingly.

It will print out all the messages from the code execution, including:

- Dependencies installation messages;
- Error messages;
- Output messages;
- Logs messages;
- and more.

## Props

```ts
interface OutputDisplayProps
  extends React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement> {}
```

## Style

The `OutputDisplay` component is an unstyled div by default. You can style it by passing your own CSS classes or styles to the `className` or `style` props, respectively.

Also, you can provide any other props that a regular `div` element accepts, such as `onClick`, `aria-label`, and `role`.
