The `Editor` component is a [Monaco Editor](https://github.com/suren-atoyan/monaco-react) wrapper that provides a simple way to configure the editor instance. It is a controlled component that listens to changes in the `code` property of the `CodeEditorProvider` and updates the editor accordingly.

This component uses a syntax highlight theme for TypeScript by default, even though you are not required to use TypeScript.

By rendering a pure Monaco Editor, you have the same VS Code experience in your application. You can configure the editor to your needs by passing the `options` prop, which accepts all the [Monaco Editor options](https://github.com/suren-atoyan/monaco-react?tab=readme-ov-file#props).

## Default Options

It has some default options that you can override:

```ts
{
  minimap: {
    enabled: false,
  },
  inlineSuggest: {
    enabled: true,
  },
  formatOnType: true,
  autoClosingBrackets: 'always',
  fixedOverflowWidgets: true,
  overviewRulerBorder: false,
  overviewRulerLanes: 0,
}
```

## Custom Theme

You can also provide a custom theme to the editor by passing the `theme` prop. This props accepts the exact same theme object that Monaco Editor uses.

You can create your own theme on [Theme Studio for VSCode](https://themes.vscode.one/).

## Samples

### Read-only Editor

If you want to instantiate a read-only editor, you can pass the `readOnly` prop as `true` alongside the `initialCode` prop containing the code snippet.

```tsx
<CodeBlock.Editor readOnly initialCode="console.log('Hello, world!');" />
```

This will result in a read-only editor with the provided code snippet.
