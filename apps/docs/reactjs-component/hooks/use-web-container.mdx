The `useWebContainer` hook is used to manage the web container instance.

It gives you access to the `WebContainerProvider` store, which allows you to interact directly with the web container instance.

Through this hook, you can access the following functions:

- `getWebContainerInstance`: Returns the web container instance
- `destroyWebContainerInstance`: Destroys the web container instance

<Warning>
  This hook is intended for advanced users who need to interact directly with the web container instance. Use it with caution.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  Ensure you call this hook only after the `WebContainerProvider` has been initialized.
