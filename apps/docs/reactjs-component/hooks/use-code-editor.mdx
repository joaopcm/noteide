The `useCodeEditor` hook is used to manage each code block editor instance.

It gives you access to the `CodeEditorProvider` store, which allows you to interact with the code block editor instance.

Through this hook, you can access the following properties:

- `code`: The code snippet
- `setCode`: Sets the code snippet
- `output`: The code snippet output
- `setOutput`: Sets the code snippet output
- `isRunning`: The code snippet running state (true/false)
- `setIsRunning`: Sets the code snippet running state
- `evaluateCode`: Prepares and isolated, secure environment and executes the code snippet

<Warning>
  Ensure you call this hook only after the `CodeEditorProvider` has been initialized.
